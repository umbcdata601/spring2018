analytics</SPAN></B> (data analysis) is the process of
inspecting,&nbsp;cleansing,&nbsp;transforming, and&nbsp;modeling&nbsp;data&nbsp;with
the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions,
and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and
approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names,
in different business, science, and social science domains.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Within
the field of&nbsp;<B>data analytics</B>, <B>machine learning</B> is a
method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend
themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known
as&nbsp;<B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">predictive analytics</SPAN></B>.
These analytical models allow researchers,&nbsp;data scientists,
engineers, and analysts to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and
results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical
relationships and trends in the data.  The primary types of analytics
with respect to data science are</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Descriptive
analytics</SPAN></B>:&nbsp;This type of analytics answers the
question, &quot;<B>What happened?</B>&quot; Descriptive analytics are
based on historical and current data. A business analyst or a
business-centric data scientist bases modern-day business
intelligence on descriptive analytics.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Diagnostic
analytics</SPAN></B>:&nbsp;You use this type of analytics to find
answers to the question, &quot;<B>why did this particular something
happen</B>?&quot; or &quot;<B>what went wrong</B>?&quot; Diagnostic
analytics are useful for deducing and inferring the success or
failure of sub-components of any data-driven initiative.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Predictive
analytics</SPAN></B>:&nbsp;Although this type of analytics is based
on historical and current data, predictive analytics go one step
further than descriptive analytics.&nbsp;<B>Predictive
analytics</B><B>&nbsp;</B><B>involve complex model-building and
analysis in order to predict a future event or trend.</B> In a
business context, these analyses would be performed by the
business-centric data scientist.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Prescriptive
analytics</SPAN></B>:&nbsp;This type of analytics aims to <B>optimize
processes, structures, and systems through informed action that's
based on predictive analytics</B> — essentially telling you what
you should do based on an informed estimation of what will happen.
Both business analysts and business-centric data scientists can
generate prescriptive analytics, but their methods and data sources
differ.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

today’s personal, business, defense, and government environments,
data is everywhere and readily available through the internet. The
problem faced by decision-makers in this environment is how to
transform data into sound decisions in a timely fashion.  This
“data-to-decision” process is at the heart of this class.  This
process is shown in the figure below

synonymous with or related to terms like business analytics,

data analysis and modeling, and knowledge extraction (also called
knowledge discovery in databases or KDD). It's just a new spin on
something that people have been doing for a long time (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Data

William S. Cleveland publishes “Data Science: An Action Plan for
Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics.” It is a
plan “to enlarge the major areas of technical work of the field of
statistics. Because the plan is ambitious and implies substantial
change, the altered field will be called ‘data science.’”
Cleveland puts the proposed new discipline in the context of computer
science and the contemporary work in data mining: “…the benefit
to the data analyst has been limited, because the knowledge among
computer scientists about how to think of and approach the analysis
of data is limited, just as the knowledge of computing environments
by statisticians is limited. A merger of knowledge bases would
produce a powerful force for innovation. This suggests that
statisticians should look to computing for knowledge today just as
data science looked to mathematics in the past.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

“Competing on Analytics,” a Babson College Working Knowledge
Research Center report, describing “the emergence of a new form of
competition based on the extensive use of analytics, data, and
fact-based decision making… Instead of competing on traditional
factors, companies are beginning to employ statistical and
quantitative analysis and predictive modeling as primary elements of
competition. ” The research is later published by Davenport in the

2005 The National Science Board publishes “Long-lived Digital Data
Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
Century.” One of the recommendations of the report reads: “The
NSF, working in partnership with collection managers and the
community at large, should act to develop and mature the career path
for data scientists and to ensure that the research enterprise
includes a sufficient number of high-quality data scientists.” The
report defines data scientists as “the information and computer
scientists, database and software engineers and programmers,
disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians,
archivists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management
of a digital data collection.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

2008 The JISC (formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee, UK)
publishes the final report of a study it commissioned to “examine

skills to the research community. “ The study’s final report,
“The Skills, Role &amp; Career Structure of Data Scientists &amp;
Curators:&nbsp; Assessment of Current Practice &amp; Future Needs,”
defines data scientists as “people who work where the research is
carried out–or, in the case of data centre personnel, in close
collaboration with the creators of the data–and may be involved in
creative enquiry and analysis, enabling others to work with digital
data, and developments in data base technology.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

identify and promote the emergence of new disciplines and specialists
expert in addressing the complex and dynamic challenges of digital
preservation, sustained access, reuse and repurposing of data. Many
disciplines are seeing the emergence of a new type of data science

years will be statisticians. People think I’m joking, but who
would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy
job of the 1990s? The ability to take data—to be able to understand
it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to
communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the
next decades… Because now we really do have essentially free and
ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to
understand that data and extract value from it… I do think those
skills—of being able to access, understand, and communicate the
insights you get from data analysis—are going to be extremely
important. Managers need to be able to access and understand the data</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

2011 D.J. Patil writes in “Building Data Science Teams”:
“Starting in 2008, Jeff Hammerbacher(@hackingdata) and I sat down
to share our experiences building the data and analytics groups at
Facebook and LinkedIn. In many ways, that meeting was the start of
data science as a distinct professional specialization… we realized
that as our organizations grew, we both had to figure out what to
call the people on our teams. ‘Business analyst’ seemed too
limiting. ‘Data analyst’ was a contender, but we felt that title
might limit what people could do. After all, many of the people on
our teams had deep engineering expertise. ‘Research scientist’
was a reasonable job title used by companies like Sun, HP, Xerox,
Yahoo, and IBM. However, we felt that most research scientists worked
on projects that were futuristic and abstract, and the work was done
in labs that were isolated from the product development teams. It
might take years for lab research to affect key products, if it ever
did. Instead, the focus of our teams was to work on data applications
that would have an immediate and massive impact on the business. The
term that seemed to fit best was data scientist: &nbsp;those who use
both data and science to create something new”.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	Our 2011 report estimated this potential in five domains; revisiting

<P>“Gautam
Tambay, cofounder and CEO of<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT><A HREF="https://www.springboard.com/"><FONT COLOR="#555555">Springboard</FONT></A>,
believes that “<B>Data is the new oil</B>.” Demand for data
scientists has gone nowhere but up in recent years — and despite
what you may think, <B>you don’t need a Ph.D. to be successful in
the field</B>. In this article, Tambay walks us through the future
(and present) of data science.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why
Is Data Science So Hot?</FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>So
why is data the new oil? “<B>The world is producing more data every
year, now, than it did in the entire 20th century</B>,” Tambay
says. “<B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Success over the next
decade is going to be largely dependent on how companies are going to
be able to turn that data into insights and actually take action on
it. I think data itself is a commodity. Everybody has it and it’s
become cheap to store it and people are sitting on volumes of data,
but what do you do with it</SPAN></B>?”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>That’s
where<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT>data science<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT>comes
in. In an age where the bombardment of information never seems to
cease, most of us just let it all flow over us, remembering a few
highlights here and there but quickly moving on to the next thing.
<B>Data scientists are the ones who can slice through all the fluff
to extract the meaning of all that information: how it’s connected
and what its implications are</B>. <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">For
companies looking to make strategic decisions, this skill is
invaluable</SPAN></B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What
Does It Take To Be A Data Scientist?</FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Most
early data scientists came straight from higher education: graduate
programs and PhDs. But Tambay attributes this correlation not to the
idea that you need higher education to be a data scientist, but
rather that the same people who are drawn to academia may be drawn to
data science as well, <B>due to their shared focus on
“hypothesis-driven experimentation and thinking about the
experiments in a very structured way and understanding the
statistics</B>.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>What
this boils down to is that a career in data science doesn’t
necessarily have to<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#000000">follow</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT>a
long academic career; rather, it can replace it. For those who have
an academic mindset but don’t want to go into academia and become
professors, <B>data science is a lucrative alternative</B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B>What
does it take? A logical mind. A tenacious attitude. A love of
experimentation. A talent for breaking down problems</B>. But the
grad degree is optional.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>One
of Tambay’s favorite real-life examples of degree-free success
is<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT><A HREF="https://www.springboard.com/success/niraj-sheth/"><FONT COLOR="#555555">Niraj
Sheth</FONT></A>, who studied liberal arts in college, then worked in
journalism, then in marketing, and is now a data scientist at Reddit
after teaching himself to code and going through the Springboard
program.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Far
from considering his background a detriment, Sheth views it as an
asset. “<B>Data science as a field is a hybrid of several other
things</B>,” he says. “<B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Fundamentally,
it is as much about people — the users you’re building for and
the coworkers you’re building it with — as it is about math and
engineering</SPAN></B>. Having a hybrid background myself has
definitely helped me understand which parts of data science to
leverage at different times.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">How
to Think Like a Data Scientist</FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If
you’re wondering whether there’s a concrete process to follow,
Tambay breaks it down for us into <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">five
steps</SPAN></B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>“First
of all, <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">you want to learn to
break down problems into its constituents</SPAN></B>. Every time you
think about why something’s happening, create a hypothesis. This
can apply day to day. When you’re doing anything with your friends.
When you see something happening, [ask] ‘why did that happen?’</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>“[Second],
think about, ‘<B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">what data would
I need to prove or disprove this hypothesis</SPAN></B>?’ Think
about why this would happen, think about a hypothesis, think about
what data you would need to prove or disprove the hypothesis, then go
find the data and see if the data confirms your hypothesis.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>“[Third],
think about <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">how to bridge the
gap between this simple hypothesis-driven thinking to actually
running large experiments</SPAN></B>. That’s where you need to
learn the statistics, that’s where you need to think about how to
clean and wrangle data, because often data is messy.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>“[Fourth],
you think about <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">how to organize
the data into analyzable form, and that’s when you need the tools</SPAN></B>,
whether it’s Python programming or a language like R or some people
will just even use SQL and Excel for smaller problems. But that’s
when you need the tools to actually analyze and conduct your
analysis.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>“Finally,
you need <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">tools to visualize and
present your insights — data storytelling</SPAN></B>.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If
you’re on the fence about exploring data science, the first and
second steps of this process are things that anyone can do, says
Tambay, and they’re a good way to gauge whether you’ll enjoy
working in the industry. <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">It all
starts, he says, with “asking the right questions.”</SPAN></B></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

today are constantly generating enormous amounts of data, but
that&nbsp;</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">doesn’t
always translate to actionable information</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.
Over the past several years, my research group at MIT and I have
sought answers to a fundamental question: What would it take for
businesses to realize the full potential of their data repositories
with&nbsp;machine learning?</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222">As
we worked to design machine learning–based solutions with a variety
of industry partners, we were surprised to find that the existing
answers to this question often didn’t apply. Why?</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222">First,
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>whenever we spoke
with machine learning experts (data scientists focused on training
and testing predictive models) about the most difficult part of their
job, they said again and again, “</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">the
data is a mess</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>.”</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">
Initially, taking that statement literally, we imagined it referred
to well-known issues with data — missing values or a lack of
coherence across databases. But as we dug deeper, we realized the
problem was slightly different. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>In
its rawest form, even clean data is too overwhelming and complex to
be understood at first glance, even by experts.</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">
It has too many tables and fields and is often collected at a very
high granularity (for example, online clickstreams generate new data
with every click, and sensor data is collected at 125 observations
per second). </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>Machine
learning experts are used to working with </B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">data
that’s already been aggregated into useful variables</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">,
such as&nbsp;the number of website visits by a user, rather than a
table of every action the&nbsp;user has ever taken&nbsp;on the site.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222">At
the same time, we often heard business experts complain that “</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>we
have a lot of data and we are not doing anything with it.</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">”
</FONT></FONT>Further
investigation revealed that this was not strictly correct either.
Instead, this frustration stems from two problems. For one thing, due
to the time it takes to understand, formulate</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">,
and process data for a machine learning problem, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>machine
learning experts often instead focus on the later parts of the
pipeline</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">—trying
different models, or tuning the hyper-parameters of the model once a
problem is formulated, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>rather
than formulating newer predictive questions for different business
problems</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.
Therefore, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">while
business experts are coming up with problems, machine learning
experts cannot always keep up.</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222">For
another, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>machine
learning experts often didn’t build their work around the final
objective—</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">deriving
business value</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.
In most cases, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>predictive
models are meant to improve efficiency, increase revenue, or reduce
costs.</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"> But the
folks actually working on the models </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>rarely
ask “</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">what
value does this predictive model provide, and how can we measure it</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>?</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">”
Asking this question about value proposition </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>often
leads to a change in the original problem formulation, and asking
such questions is often </B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">more
useful</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>
than tweaking later stages of the process</B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.
At a recent panel filled with machine learning enthusiasts, I polled
the audience of about 150 people, asking “How many of you have
built a machine learning model?” Roughly one-third raised their
hands. Next, I asked, “How many of you have deployed and/or used
this model to generate value, and evaluated it?” No one had their
hand up.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222">In
other words, the </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>machine
learning experts wanted to spend their time building models, </B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">not
processing massive datasets or translating business problems into
prediction problems</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.
Likewise, the current technological landscape, both commercial and
academic, focuses on enabling more sophisticated models (via Latent
variable models), scaling model learning algorithms (via distributed
compute), or fine-tuning (via Bayesian hyper
optimization)—essentially all later stages of the data science
pipeline. However, in our experience, </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">we
found this focus to be misplaced</SPAN></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If
companies want to get value from their data, they need to focus on
<B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">accelerating human understanding
of data, scaling the number of modeling questions they can ask of
that data in a short amount of time, and assessing their
implications</SPAN></B>. In our work with companies, we ultimately
decided that <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">creating true
impact via machine learning will come from a focus on four
principles</SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">:</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Stick
with simple models:</SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>We

on<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>random forests<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>or
decision trees, are sufficient for the problems at hand. The <B>focus
should instead be on reducing the time between the data acquisition
and the development of the first simple predictive model</B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Explore
more problems</SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>Data
scientists need the ability to rapidly define and explore multiple
prediction problems, quickly and easily. Instead of exploring one
business problem with an incredibly sophisticated machine learning
model, <B>companies should be exploring dozens, building a simple
predictive model for each one and assessing their value proposition</B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Learn
from a sample of data - not all the data:</SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>&nbsp;</B></FONT>Instead

techniques that will enable the derivations of similar conclusions

hypotheses.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff; line-height: 100%">
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Focus

Over and over across different data problems, we found ourselves
applying similar data processing techniques, whether it was to
transform the data into useful aggregates, or to prepare data for
predictive modeling—it’s time to streamline these, and to develop
algorithms and build software systems that do them automatically.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This
acute understanding of how data scientists interact with data and
where the bottlenecks are led us to launch “The Human-Data
Interaction Project” at MIT, focusing on the goals listed above.
Our target is rapid exploration of predictive models, and to actually
put them to use by solving real problems in real organizations. These
models will be simple, and automation will enable even naive users to
develop hundreds if not thousands of predictive models within
hours—something that, today, takes experts entire months.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P>“<B>You
can be a good data scientist by sitting at your computer</B>. After
all, the job description involves poring through huge quantities of
often disparate data to find insights that may prove helpful in every
aspect of a business, including marketing, logistics, and human
resources. It also includes cleaning data, dealing with gaps, and
sifting through incomplete poor definitions.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">But
great data scientists know they must do more</SPAN></B>. They
recognize that there are nuances and quality issues in the data that
they can’t understand while sitting at their desks. They recognize
that the <B>world is filled with “soft data,” relevant sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, and textures that are yet to be digitized</B>
—&nbsp;and hence are unavailable to those working at their
computers. (Think of things like the electricity in the air at a
political rally and the fear in the eyes of an executive faced with
an unexpected threat.) They know they must understand the larger
context, the real problems and opportunities,<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>how
decision makers decide, and how their predictions will be used.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Great
data scientists know the only way to acquire this smorgasbord of
information is to go get it</SPAN></B>. So they spend time on the
road with truckers, probe decision makers, wander the factory floor,
pretend to be a customer, ask experts in other disciplines for help,
and so forth. They delve deeply into processes of data creation and
the complexities of measurement equipment. They ask old hands how
their recommendations will be used, what the likely results are, and
what can go wrong.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Consider
an example from the oil business. Where the oil is thick, it is hard
to pump out of the ground. To make this process easier, companies
heat the oil first with steam. Steam is expensive and must be used
according to strict ecological guidelines, so putting the right
amount in is critical. A good data scientist can take many factors
into account —&nbsp;the underlying geology, the current temperature
of the oil, the well’s production history&nbsp;— to optimize
the&nbsp;amount of steam.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>But
a great data scientist would also spend some time in the oil field.
There, they&nbsp;would notice that the probe used to estimate current
temperature is sometimes lowered into the well clean, while at other
times it is covered with mud. As it happens, mud is a great
insulator, leading to a “too-low” temperature and, in turn, too
much steam. Having verified this through a simple experiment, the
great data scientist will tackle the root of the issue, namely the
lack of a work instruction advising the technician to insert a clean
probe.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Great
data scientists are deeply curious about the data and everything
surrounding it</SPAN></B>. In this case, optimizing the amount of
steam is important, but rooting out the data quality issue (the
mud-covered probe) is more fundamental and saves millions of dollars.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B>Not
all&nbsp;data scientists spend enough time understanding the deeper
reality they study</B>. <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Some
concentrate too much on the numbers</SPAN></B><B>.</B> For example,
in <B>predicting the most recent election</B>, the place to be was in
the mind of the potential voter. You can’t go there directly, so
many individuals and publications, from the New York Times to the
Princeton Election Commission, used polls to predict who would win.
But most were way off.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Many
people have<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>dissected how this may
have happened, but I’d argue that it comes down to what a great
data scientist does that a lesser one may not. <B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Great
data scientists know they have to understand the strengths and
weaknesses in the data in great detail</SPAN></B>. Polling is
fraught,<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>as Nate Silver cautioned,
and great data scientists worry more about<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>nonsampling
error<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>than about models for
aggregating polls. They study the accuracy of past polls, ask
themselves what would happen if people lie to pollsters, and ponder
biases such as whether people who say they are likely to vote will
actually do so. A few in the media commented on how they felt much
more energy at Trump rallies than at Clinton rallies, even suggesting
that this could translate to&nbsp;greater turnout&nbsp;for his
supporters. <B>Great data scientists conduct such analyses to develop
a wider perspective</B>.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>What’s
more, <B>great data scientists cast a wide net in looking for
relevant data</B>.<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>Might Americans
distrust political dynasty, lowering the chances of a candidate
seeking election after a two-term president from her party?&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#222222">Might
economic performance help —&nbsp;or hurt —&nbsp;the incumbent
party?&nbsp;</FONT>Might the winner of the Super Bowl&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#222222">correlate
with the winner of the election</FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222">?</FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Of
course, <B>a healthy dose of skepticism should go with each of these
analyses</B> (it’s hard to see any relationship between a football
game and a presidential election), but for <B>great data scientists,
this business of exploring the world from as many angles as possible,
being deeply curious about the data, whether digitized or not, and
asking how the pieces fit together never stops</B>. If you’re not
actively doing these things, take steps to fold this into your daily
work.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">First,

Measurement instruments get clogged with sand, pollsters don’t
follow their scripts, and survey developers inadvertently<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>design
their instruments<FONT COLOR="#222222">&nbsp;</FONT>in ways that bias

who will make time to explain the business. Get them to introduce you
to others, and ask a couple of them to serve as informal <B>mentors</B>.
You may have to nudge them from time to time, but you’ll very
likely find plenty of people eager to help.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Third,
